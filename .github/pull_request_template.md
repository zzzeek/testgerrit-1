*** S T O P ! ! ! *** 

Is this pull request changing code?   If so, 
Does your pull request include a TEST CASE ?    
Or have you filed a proper bug report that includes
a TEST CASE?

*** WE DO NOT ACCEPT ONE-LINER CODE-FIX PULL REQUESTS
WITH NO TESTS. ***

These fixes are very often incorrect, inappropriate, 
and above all save us no effort at all because WE 
NEED TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  Do NOT assume we 
"know" what the problem is without showing us.  The effort 
you can contribute is in WRITING THE TESTS, and if you
can't do that, file a bug report.

if you cannot write a test, FILE A BUG REPORT
that includes a MINIMAL, COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE EXAMPLE.
Pull requests that fix just one line and don't take the
effort to illustrate the problem in terms of code 
CANNOT and WILL NOT be merged.
